Hi! Here are some instructions on how to run this app locally on your machine.

prereqs
- Git will be needed to clone the project to your machine: you can download and install it from git-scm.com 
- Node will be needed to install dependencies, you can download it from nodejs.org 

1.  open terminal/command prompt 
2.  clone the repo by running this command 
    
    git clone https://github.com/gojoego/finch_employee_directory

3.  once that's done, go into that folder using this command: 

    cd finch_employee_directory

4.  now it's time to install dependencies needed for this project to run, 
    you can use this command for that:

    npm install 

5.  all the dependencies should be install and the app should run by
    entering this command: 

    npm start

6.  http://localhost:3000 should open up automatically in your default browser 
    but you can copy and paste this address into your browser of choice
